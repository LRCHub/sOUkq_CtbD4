All of these folks
On the tv have their reasons
Like you on your hill
Consuming en masse with your buddies

Evertyime I watch them all go by
I take in a breath and let out a sigh
I don't know how much of this i can handle
Excuse me is my rant taking too long?
Is it getting in the way of this lovely song?
Just promise me that you'll never leave
I'd die if you leave me

When I was young
All of these things didn't matter
But now times have changed
And I wasn't paying attention

So fuck you and your mass media toys
That make being alive seem like a chore
I don't know how much of this i can handle
Excuse me is my rant taking too long?
Is it getting in the way of this lovely song?
Just promise me that you'll never leave
I'd die if you leave me
